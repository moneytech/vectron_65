# Vectron 65

The Vectron 65 is a 6502 CPU-based breadboard computer.  It supports VGA output, keyboard input, boots into a BASIC interpreter, and has lots of GPIOs.

This computer is a much-upgraded version of my original [Vectron 64 computer](https://github.com/nickbild/vectron_64).

## Specs

* [65C02 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) clocked at 8 Mhz.
* 32KB RAM
* 32KB EEPROM
  - Programmable via [custom Arduino Mega 2560 based platform](https://github.com/nickbild/eeprom_burner_mega).
* 400x300 @ 60Hz VGA output, as 50x30 text mode display. See my [MiniVGA Text Mode](https://github.com/nickbild/fpga_vga_text_mode) project for details.
* PS/2 keyboard support.
* Boots into Tom Pittman's Tiny Basic.
* 19 GPIOs
* Built with 7400 series logic contemporary with the original 6502 CPU (with the exception of the FPGA-based VGA output).
